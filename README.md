# Done_With_It
This repository includes a react-native mobile application called done with it where you can list the product that you do not need anymore and others can view, buy it from there.

The App is created keeping in mind the concepts of Object Oriented Programming hence you might see glips of all (Inheritence,Encapsulation, Absraction and Ploymorphism).

Let me take you through the UI and working of the app that how it looks and feels like 
The First Screen of thr app is a Welcome Screen that has both the primary operations (Login and Register), as shown

Once the user is logged in then the main Screen appears that contains all the listing posted by the users of the app at the bottom there appears a Bottom Tab Navigator with three options The first one is the homepage itself then a beautiful round icon indicates the add listings page from where the user can post the listings onto the app. Once the user clicks on post a beautiful annimation and loader appears on to the screen. (Note: all these components are inside the components folder)

Besides posting the listings the user can contact the sender of the listing through message and communicate with each other through app. as shown below. for which a meesage input box is added and displayed when the user opens a particular post/listing

At last the Pofile Button takes you to the Account Details Screen where the user details and few options are available that includes the messages in which user can see the messages he recieved from others on the app, he can calso delete the messages by swiping right. Beneath that appears the My listings  where user can view the listings posted by himself and last the option to logout from the app.

Important Note: this Repository aims to highlight the UI components and focus on the development hence the AppBackend attached along with it is just a temporary data base just to test the functionality of the app and test its behaviour. Inoreder to use it as a professional app you need to make your own database using python or Ruby etc (whichever you prefer).
